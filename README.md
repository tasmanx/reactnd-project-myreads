# MyReads Project

This is final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 

## Install

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* install PropTypes with `npm install --save prop-types`
* install React Router with `npm install --save react-router-dom`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Quick User Guide

* in order to change book's bookshelf you need to press green button on the book and then choose the bookshelf
* to add new books to your bookshelfs you need to press green button with the plus sign inside it which is in the bottom-right conner. Then just type something in the search bar and do the first step.

## Backend Server

The file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults)
```

* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
